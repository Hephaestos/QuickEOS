# QuickEOS
v1.0

A little script to quickly log into the GVSU EOS servers using Pulse VPN

Suggested Use:
- Put it in `~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Scripts`
- Add an alias to your `$PROFILE` like `Set-Alias -Name QuickEOS -Value ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Scripts\QuickEOS.ps1`

Or however you like, don't let me tell you what to do.
If you don't like my very mediocre PowerShell scripting, send me a PR.
Enjoy :)
